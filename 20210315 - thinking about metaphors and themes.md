# 20210315 - thinking about metaphors and themes

- thinking about chaos and loss of control
- about the pleasure of playing and catching
- of disorientation, and our desperation to orient ourselves 
- desperation to know where we are; to locate ourselves. 
- instability

We are all trying to figure out where are.

He is painfully aware
That this will end soon.



>The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep 
>Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends, 
>'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.

- Tennyson, Ulysses
