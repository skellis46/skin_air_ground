Spending some time with the footage I've shot. 

Imagined having Finn or someone doing throwing and catching while I move in the space below #ideatotry 

Thought about just dropping to the ground as quickly as possible and finding unusual/strange ways to catch the camera. #ideatotry Do I need to pad the camera to make it easier to catch? How would that work? 

Find ways of interupting the falling and moving camera -- almost as if tripping it up or disturbing its trajectory #ideatotry 

Definitely try a quick edit when the camera is never being caught, or in some way attempting to disguise how/what is happening? #ideatotry 

Wondering about words to say during the throwing/catching, or perhaps making some kind of sounds #ideatotry  But any kind of text (say text spoken over the top of the video or displayed on the project) needs to be thought through carefully. What am I doing here? Who/what is this in relationship to? 

Who might build a soundtrack/score? 

Need to work with camera much more like hot potatoes #ideatotry
