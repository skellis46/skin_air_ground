# 20210308 - make a parachute

First day trying with throwing GoPro in the air. Surprising results -- quite stable, and very usable at slow motion. Most successful at 120fps slowed down to 12.5 fps in PP. Lil suggested trying with a a parachute. #ideatotry  I got caught up in the sound. Made tumbling.mp4 and sent to Josh Slater and Lee Miller:

Thought about videos that are only ever just lifting off (never seeing/hearing the 'crash' of the catch until perhaps the end.
